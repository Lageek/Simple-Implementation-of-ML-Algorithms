# Simple-Implementation-of-ML-Algorithms
My simplest implementations of common ML algorithms using only numpy.
For an easy understanding, most of the codes use toy datasets and within 100 lines of codes.

* Logistic Regression
* Naive Bayes
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* Gradient Boost Decision Tree
* XGBoost
* Genetic Algorithm
* Multilayer Perceptron
* Convolutional Neural Network

Working on:
* Support Vector Machine (SMO)
* Adaboost
* Hidden Markov Model
* Beyasian Network
* Generative Adversarial Networks
* Deep Q-Network (Reenforcement learning)
* RNN
* LSTM

Feel free to use the code. Please contact me if you have any questions: xiecng@gmail.com
