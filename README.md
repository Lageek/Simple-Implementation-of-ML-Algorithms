# Simple-Implementation-of-ML-Algorithms
My simplest implementations of common ML algorithms using only numpy.
For an easy understanding, most of the codes implements only minimal versin of the algorithm and within 100 lines of codes.

* Ridge Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Factorization machines
* Naive Bayes
* Beyasian Network
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* Adaboost
* Gradient Boost Decision Tree
* XGBoost
* Genetic Algorithm
* Hidden Markov Model
* Multilayer Perceptron
* Convolutional Neural Network

Working on:
* Support Vector Machine (SMO)
* Restricted Boltzmann machine
* Generative Adversarial Networks
* Deep Q-Network (Reinforcement learning)
* Recurrent neural network
* Long short-term memory

Feel free to use the code. Please contact me if you have any questions: xiecng@gmail.com
