# Simple-Implementation-of-ML-Algorithms
My simplest implementations of common ML algorithms using only numpy.
For an easy understanding, most of the codes implements only minimal versin of the algorithm and within 100 lines of codes.

* Regression Models
    * Ridge Regression
    * Logistic Regression
    * Factorization Machines

* Bayes Models
    * Naive Bayes
    * Beyasian Network

* Tree Models and Ensemble Learning
    * Decision Tree
    * Random Forest
    * Adaboost
    * Gradient Boost Decision Tree
    * XGBoost

* Deep Learning
    * Multilayer Perceptron
    * Convolutional Neural Network

* Optimization Algorithms (See implementations in Regression and MLP)
	* Stochastic Gradient Descent
	* Gradient Descent with Momentum
	* Nesterov Momentum
	* AdaGrad
	* RMSProp
	* Adam

* k-Nearest Neighbors
