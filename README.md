# Simple-Implementation-of-ML-Algorithms
My simplest implementations of common ML algorithms using only numpy.
For an easy understanding, most of the codes use toy datasets and within 100 lines of codes.

* Logistic Regression
* Naive Bayes
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* XGBoost
* Genetic Algorithm
* Multilayer Perceptron

Working on:
* Convolutional Neural Network
* Generative Adversarial Networks
* RNN
* LSTM
* Reenforcement learning

Will update in the future
* Linear Regression
* k-NN
* k-Means
* GMM
* PCA
* Hidden Markov Model
* Support Vector Machine (SMO)
* Manifold Learning
* Adaboost
* SVD
* Lasso
* Beyasian Network
* Maximum Entropy Model
* Genetic Programming
* Swarm Intelligence
